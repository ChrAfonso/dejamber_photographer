Theme: "Stay in Place"

by Stefan Putzinger, Oliver Rotter, Christian Afonso

It's holiday time in the futuristic post-pandemic year of 2022! Gather the whole family in the festive christmas mall and take a wunderful picture to capture this cheerful moment. But what's this? Grandpa's asleep? Grandma wants her pills? The kids run off to the playhouse? There's something cool on TV? And the lights on the tree need fixing? Better make sure you get everyone back into the frame and in a happy mood!

How to play:

- drag the characters back to their positions

- click the grandparents to wake them up

- pull items onto the characters to make them happy

- flick away shoppers running into the frame

...then click the camera to take the best pictures you can! (You have three shots)
